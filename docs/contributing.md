# Introduction

We welcome any new contribution to the repository to improve the codebase or add new features

## Issues

### Prerequisites

* [ ] Have you [searched for duplicates](https://github.com/VishwasShashidhar/car-os/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=)?  A simple search for exception error messages or a summary of the unexpected behaviour should suffice.
* [ ] Are you running the latest version?
* [ ] Are you sure this is a bug or missing capability?

### Raising an Issue

* Create your issue [here](https://github.com/VishwasShashidhar/car-os/issues/new).
* New issues contain a simple template, ensure you fill it up appropriately
  * Also tag the new issue with either "Bug" or "Enhancement".
* Use [Markdown formatting](https://help.github.com/categories/writing-on-github/) liberally to assist in readability.
  * [Code fences](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks/) for exception stack traces and log entries, for example, massively improve readability.

## Pull Requests (Code & Docs)

To make review of PRs easier, please:

* Ensure your PRs will merge cleanly - PRs that don't are unlikely to be accepted.
* For code contributions, follow the existing code layout.
* For documentation contributions, follow the general structure, language, and tone of the [existing docs](../).
* See [Commit Guidelines](commit_guideline.md) on how to format your commits
* Reference issue #s if your PR has anything to do with an issue (even if it doesn't address it).
* Minimise non-functional changes (e.g. whitespace).
